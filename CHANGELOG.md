## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-20

Bug fixes, project hardening, and maintenance/security updates. No
public API changes; no behavior changes outside the specific fixes
called out below.

### Security

- **Bumped dev pin `pytest==8.4.2` → `pytest==9.0.3`** to clear
  GHSA-6w46-j5rx-g56g / CVE-2025-71176 (vulnerable `tmpdir` handling
  in pytest, medium / CVSS 6.8). Dev-only dependency, not in
  `requirements.lock`. `pytest 9.0.3` was uploaded 2026-04-07 — 22
  days before the 2026-04-29 phase-1 staging wave, comfortably past
  the project's ≥2-week pre-staging margin. Updated both
  `pyproject.toml` and the hand-pinned `--no-deps` step in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Verified locally: 31/31 offline tests
  pass and the MCP offline import boot succeeds on 9.0.3.

  The 8 → 9 major bump touches deprecated pytest 8.x APIs the suite
  doesn't use; no test code changes required. Transitive dep floors
  shifted slightly (`iniconfig>=1.0.1`, `packaging>=22`) but our
  existing pins (`iniconfig==2.3.0`, `packaging==25.0`) already
  satisfy them.

  `idna` (GHSA-65pc-fj4g-8rjx / CVE-2026-45409) was reviewed in the
  same pass and intentionally NOT bumped: the patched `idna 3.15`
  was uploaded 2026-05-12, one day after the main Mini Shai-Hulud
  disclosure wave, and the prior 3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14 / 3.15 releases
  shipped in a four-week cluster around the incident — well outside
  this package's normal release rhythm. The actual attack surface
  (`idna.encode()` on attacker-controlled hostnames) isn't reachable
  here: `edgar-connect` only contacts hardcoded SEC and Yahoo
  Finance endpoints. The Dependabot alert was dismissed with
  rationale; `idna` stays pinned at `3.11` until a clean
  post-window release with normal release-cadence margin is
  available.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/build_comps.py`: point-in-time screening sheets no longer
  look ahead.** Three related issues in the CapIQ snapshot path:
  - `_pick_annual_period()` previously returned a period whose calendar
    year matched `--as-of`'s year prefix, or fell back to the most
    recent annual unconditionally. Non-Dec filers (e.g. Apple's
    2025-09-27 FYE) could therefore be selected on an early-year
    screen (`--as-of 2025-03-31`), producing look-ahead bias. The
    resolver is now "latest annual period `<= as_of`, else `None`".
  - `_capiq_snapshot()` and `_trailing_annual_revenue()` were fed the
    primary normalized parse, which is governed by `--period-type`.
    When the user requested `--period-type quarterly` for the
    `Metrics` sheet, the screening helpers received a quarterly slice
    and silently produced wrong / blank annual-only columns. The
    snapshot path now always runs an explicit annual `parse_company_facts`
    in addition to the primary parse, decoupling the screening sheets
    from the matrix period type.
  - The live-mode env-var check accepted only `EDGAR_IDENTITY`, while
    the rest of the project (via `config/constants.py`) also accepts
    `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` as an alias. The check is now centralized
    in a new `_has_identity()` helper that mirrors the existing
    resolver, so the screening script is no longer an outlier.

  Verified by a new offline regression suite at
  `tests/test_build_comps.py` (13 tests; no live SEC calls) covering
  the as-of cutoff (including the AAPL-style "Sep FYE / Q1 screen"
  case), Dec-filer behaviour, the all-future-annuals fallback,
  trailing-revenue strip cutoff, the quarterly-mode decoupling, and
  the identity alias matrix. Pytest passes 31/31; `--dry-run`
  smoke-checked against the 25-filer SIC 5500 universe.

### Added

- **Comparables workbook builder (`scripts/build_comps.py`).** A
  styled, no-anchor comps tool: filters `data/company_index.json` by
  SIC (`--sic`) plus optional `--name-substring` /
  `--exclude-subindustry` / `--exclude-name` / `--country-inc` /
  `--revenue-country` / `--limit`, then pulls Company Facts for every
  peer and writes a single Excel workbook. Sheet layout: `Universe`
  (one row per peer with the classification fields from
  `company_index.json` — name, ticker, CIK, SIC, industry,
  subindustry, country / state of incorporation, dominant revenue
  country, geographic revenue breakdown, latest annual period),
  `Metrics` (peers × (metric × relative fiscal period) matrix;
  columns are FY 0 / FY -1 / FY -2 ... so peers with different fiscal
  calendars line up), CapIQ-mirror `Screening_24col` /
  `Screening_36col` (single point-in-time snapshot per peer at
  `--as-of`: LTM = trailing 4 quarters ≤ as-of for non-Dec filers,
  else the FY-aligned annual; 36-col layout adds 6 trailing LTM
  revenue columns), one drilldown sheet per peer with BS / IS / CF
  normalized line items stacked, and an `About` methodology sheet.
  Header band styled bold-white on navy (`1F3864`); freeze panes,
  auto-filter, and per-unit accounting / ratio / turnover / days
  number formats applied across all sheets. CapIQ-layout uses the
  same LTM resolver pattern as the archived
  `reconcile_capiq_screening` (FY-aligned annual when the latest
  annual matches as-of, else `build_ltm_statement` from quarterly +
  prior annual). CapIQ forward analyst-estimate columns (cols 26–29)
  are blank by design — EDGAR has no equivalent and they are never
  fabricated. Metric set defaults to a 27-slug analyst-friendly
  bundle (revenue / margin / working-capital / leverage / returns)
  drawn from the existing registry; overridable via `--metrics`.
  Optional `--extensions` merges captive-finance extension XBRL
  (`EQUIPMENT_FINANCE_RULES`); 5Y monthly β + R² vs ^GSPC is on by
  default (fail-soft: a Yahoo Finance error blanks the two β columns
  for that peer rather than aborting the build, and the regression's
  own `_MIN_OBS=24` cutoff blanks names with <2 years of history);
  `--no-beta` disables the computation; `--no-capiq-layout` skips
  the Screening / submissions / quarterly path for a faster build. Live runs require
  `EDGAR_IDENTITY` or `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT`; `--dry-run` previews the peer set offline.
  openpyxl is the workbook writer (already in deps); no new
  dependencies. Verified end-to-end against an 11-peer auto-dealer
  universe (SIC 5500) — 11/11 peers pulled, Screening_36col
  populated with hand-checked Lithia Motors (LAD) trailing revenue:
  FY25 37,634.9 $mm, LTM-1 (FY24) 36,188.2 ✓, LTM-2 (FY23) 31,042.3 ✓,
  LTM-3 (FY22) 28,187.8 ✓ — all matching published 10-K filings; β /
  R² populated for 10/11 peers (CVNA 3.35, LAD 1.25, KMX 1.20, CRMT
  1.21, RUSHA 0.90, SAH 0.91, PAG 0.88, GPI 0.85, AN 0.78, ABG 0.77;
  VRM blank — <24 months of post-restructuring history hits the
  `_MIN_OBS` cutoff in `compute_peer_betas`, soft-failed as designed).
  CapIQ-style header / freeze panes / auto-filter applied; About
  sheet documents blank-by-design columns.

- **`company_index.json` update system (`scripts/update_company_index.py`).**
  Snapshot rebuild of the local company classification index from one or
  more SEC Financial Statement Data Set quarters. Forward-only integrity
  via a new manifest at `data/company_index.source.json` (sha256 of the
  index file, FSDS quarters used, per-quarter zip shas, build counts,
  applied-rebuild history); `check` and `rebuild` refuse to operate on a
  hand-edited index (rc=2). The classifier in
  `edgar/company_classifier.py` is reused as-is via a temporary scratch
  directory, so the index produced by this tool is byte-equal to one
  built manually via `python -m edgar.company_classifier --build` on the
  same inputs. Diff splits "changed" entries into `changed_period_only`
  (expected, low signal — the latest annual moved forward) and
  `changed_substantive` (any other field differs — worth surfacing).
  Subcommands: `init`, `check`,
  `rebuild QUARTER [QUARTER...] [--source-zip QUARTER=PATH ...] [--apply] [--report PATH]`
  (dry-run by default). Live download path requires `EDGAR_IDENTITY`;
  `--source-zip` allows offline / CI runs. stdlib-only.

- **`sec_tag_mapping.json` update system (`scripts/update_sec_tag_mapping.py`).**
  Maintenance tool for the Layer-1 backing data. Pulls a new SEC Financial
  Statement Data Set quarter, derives a candidate mapping, and additively
  merges only new us-gaap tags into the existing file; existing
  classifications are preserved. Forward-only integrity is enforced by a
  new manifest at `data/sec_tag_mapping.source.json` (sha256 of the
  mapping file, last applied FSDS quarter + zip sha256, applied-update
  history); `check` and `update` refuse to operate on a hand-edited
  mapping (rc=2). The closed 9-pair `(statement, category)` vocabulary is
  pinned in the manifest and enforced by a schema check. New tags are
  auto-classified only when per-statement regex rules fire confidently
  (high precision, low recall, mirroring the BS/CF prefilters in
  `edgar.metrics`); ambiguous tags land in a `needs_review` report for
  hand-adjudication. Non-vocab statement codes (PR/UN/SI/CP/EQ/CI) and
  non-us-gaap concepts (dei, srt) are filtered out. Subcommands: `init`,
  `check`, `update QUARTER [--source-zip PATH] [--apply] [--report PATH]`
  (dry-run by default). Live download path requires `EDGAR_IDENTITY`;
  `--source-zip` allows offline / CI runs. stdlib-only — no new
  dependencies. README and MAPPING.md updated with the new flow.

- **Repository policy files (`SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).**
  `SECURITY.md` points security reports at GitHub Private Vulnerability
  Reporting (no public issues/PRs), documents that only the latest
  commit on `main` is supported, and codifies the supply-chain posture
  (pinned versions, hash-locked `requirements.lock`, no ad-hoc
  `pipx run` / `npx`). `CONTRIBUTING.md` records the personal-public-repo
  contribution model: no direct collaborator access, all external
  contributions via fork PRs against `jibarix/edgar-connect:main`, with
  the same CI gate, one approving review, conversation resolution, and
  blocked force-push / branch deletion expectations enforced by branch
  protection. Both files are referenced from the README and from each
  other.

### Fixed

- **CI: editable install under `--no-build-isolation` now works.** Added
  `wheel==0.46.3` (PyPI verified 2026-01-22, pre-incident) to the
  audited dev tooling step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Without it,
  `--no-build-isolation` did not provision the wheel build backend
  (setup-python ships setuptools but not wheel), so the editable install
  step failed with `invalid command 'bdist_wheel'`.

### Removed

- **Dead imports and unused internal helpers.** Trimmed orphan imports
  in `edgar/company_classifier.py`, `utils/cache.py`, `edgar/xbrl_parser.py`,
  `edgar/metrics/returns.py`, `edgar/metrics/_slot_selection.py`, and
  dropped eight unused validators / two unused helpers from
  `utils/validators.py` and `utils/helpers.py`. No public API change; no
  behavior change. Verified by static analysis (no callers in the engine,
  CLI, MCP server, or tests) and the existing offline CI suite.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **Hardened CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).** Triggers on
  `push`/`pull_request` to `main` only; no `pull_request_target`;
  least-privilege token (`permissions: contents: read`); third-party
  actions pinned to full commit SHAs. Install is hash-verified from the
  Windows/cp311 `requirements.lock` plus exact, supply-chain-audited dev
  pins (`--no-deps`) and an editable `--no-build-isolation --no-deps`
  install — no fresh dependency resolve, consistent with the active
  Mini Shai-Hulud policy. Runs `pytest` and an offline MCP server import
  boot; no live SEC calls (`EDGAR_IDENTITY` intentionally unset).
  Pinned to `windows-latest` / Python 3.11 to match the committed lock;
  a Linux runner would force an incident-blocked cross-platform resolve.

### Changed

- **`requires-python` corrected to `>=3.11`.** The pinned dependency
  set (`pandas==3.0.2`, `numpy==2.4.4`) requires Python 3.11+, so the
  package cannot install on a lower interpreter. Published metadata now
  matches that reality; README updated to `Python 3.11+` and the prior
  "source-compatible vs lock-verified" ambiguity removed. Lowering the
  floor again would require a separately generated and audited
  3.10-compatible dependency set with CI validation first.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **CLI `--cik` fallback path.** A CIK-only request set `ticker = "UNKNOWN"`,
  and the HTML/XML fallback resolved filings purely from ticker, so it could
  never succeed for CIK-only usage. `StatementExtractor` now threads an
  optional `cik` through `extract_statement` /
  `get_statement_soup` / `get_statement_file_names_in_filing_summary` via a
  new `_resolve_cik` helper that prefers an explicit CIK over ticker lookup.
- **Fallback statement metadata.** `format_statement_data()` derived
  `period_type` from `statement_type` (`"annual" if statement_type ==
  "annual" else "quarterly"`), a check that could never be true, so the
  non-`ALL` path always reported `"quarterly"` and the `ALL` path hardcoded
  `"annual"`. The real `period_type` is now threaded through both branches.
- **Interactive CLI crash on bad input.** Company-selection and
  number-of-periods prompts called `int(input(...))` unguarded; a
  non-numeric keystroke raised an uncaught `ValueError` and aborted the
  session. A new `prompt_int()` helper re-prompts instead.

### Changed

- **Smoke test now fails loudly.** `scripts/smoke_test_metrics.py` previously
  printed `Periods loaded: []`, logged connection errors, and still exited
  `0` when live SEC fetches failed. It now exits non-zero on empty Company
  Facts, no parsed periods, or all-`None` metrics, so a failed live run is a
  real failure signal.
- **Pinned dev tooling for supply-chain safety.** Replaced the unpinned
  `pytest>=8.0` dev extra with `pytest==8.4.2` plus an explicit
  `packaging==25.0` transitive override, consistent with the runtime pin
  policy (versions verified uploaded before the active incident window).

### Added

- **Offline regression test suite (`tests/`, 18 tests).** No live SEC calls;
  covers the `--cik` resolver precedence and signature contract,
  `period_type` threading, `prompt_int` re-prompt behavior, and the derived
  metric registry surface.

### Validation

- Live SEC validation performed against Apple Inc. (CIK 0000320193): the
  fail-loud smoke test passed (exit 0, hand-verified FY2025 figures) and a
  live CIK-only `--cik` CLI run produced a correct multi-period income
  statement. The CIK-only run exercised the primary XBRL route; the
  HTML/XML fallback remains covered by unit tests rather than a live run.
