"""Hierarchy-aware tag selection inside a closed-set slot.

The Layer-2 buildup (`statement_buildup`) resolves every us-gaap concept
to a frozen slot, but a single filer routinely tags the *same economic
quantity at several levels of the XBRL hierarchy* into one slot:

  * net **and** gross **and** components
    (``PropertyPlantAndEquipmentNet`` + ``…Gross`` + ``BuildingsAndImprovementsGross`` + ``Land``)
  * a bundled superset **and** the narrow line
    (``CashCashEquivalentsAndShortTermInvestments`` + ``CashAndCashEquivalentsAtCarryingValue``)
  * a net rollup **and** its decomposition
    (``DeferredTaxAssetsNet`` + ``…DeferredIncome`` + ``…Other``)

A naive "sum every tag in the slot" double-counts all three patterns —
that is exactly what blew the Microsoft balance-sheet identity out by
~$720 B. This module is the fix, and it deliberately mirrors the
income-statement selection model in ``_concepts.py``: **pick the single
most authoritative reported line per slot rather than summing the
hierarchy.**

Resolution-source precedence is the backbone. The shipped deterministic
pre-filter is high-precision / low-recall: when it is *confident* about a
tag it has found THE canonical reported line for that slot. The compiled
fan-out map only carries what the pre-filter left ambiguous —
components, bundles, alternates, and the occasional mis-slotted
disclosure. So a ``prefilter`` tag categorically beats a ``map`` tag in
the same slot.

Slot shape then decides what to do with the survivors:

  * **single-line slots** (cash, ppe_net, goodwill, retained_earnings, …)
    are ONE reported figure — collapse to a single tag.
  * **additive slots** (the ``other_*`` catch-alls, ``common_stock_apic``
    = par + APIC, ``short_term_debt`` = CP + current LTD, and every
    non-subtotal cash-flow slot, which is additive by construction) keep
    the distinct survivors and sum them, after stripping gross/net and
    rollup double-counts.

The synthetic balanced filer the offline oracle uses has exactly one tag
per slot, so every rule below is a no-op there (a lone candidate is
returned unchanged) — the structural contract is preserved.
