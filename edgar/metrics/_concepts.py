"""Fallback chains for us-gaap concept names.

Issuers vary in which concept they tag for the same logical line item
(e.g. revenue is `Revenues` for some, `RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax`
for others). Each entry below is an ordered list — the resolver picks
the first match with non-null values.

Tuples are (category, concept_name). The category disambiguates when
the same concept name appears under different statement classifications
(rare but happens).
